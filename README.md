## 🚀 **Prototype Progress and Key Outputs**

### 1️⃣ **Demand Forecasting Using ARIMA and LSTM**

#### 🔧 **ARIMA Model**
- **Purpose:** Predict future demand trends based on historical data.
- **Output:**
  - RMSE: `45,497,368.76`
  - MAPE: `71.43%`
- **Observations:**
  - High error rates indicated the ARIMA model struggled to capture seasonality and complex patterns.

#### 🤖 **LSTM Model**
- **Purpose:** Improve forecast accuracy using a deep learning approach for long-term dependencies.
- **Output:**
  - RMSE: `16,783,985.66`
  - MAPE: `21.61%`
  - Forecasted Sales for the next 3 months:

| Date       | Forecasted Sales |
|------------|------------------|
| 2019-07-31 | 54,650,044.0     |
| 2019-08-31 | 50,461,212.0     |
| 2019-09-30 | 47,025,604.0     |

- **Observations:**
  - Significant improvement in accuracy compared to ARIMA.

### 2️⃣ **Inventory Optimization Using EOQ**

- **Purpose:** Calculate the optimal order quantity to minimize inventory costs.
- **Method:** Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) formula dynamically calculated based on LSTM forecasts.
- **Output:**
  - Example EOQ for forecasted sales:

| Date       | Forecasted Sales | EOQ (Units) |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| 2019-07-31 | 54,650,044.0     | 1044.06     |
| 2019-08-31 | 50,461,212.0     | 1007.47     |
| 2019-09-30 | 47,025,604.0     | 968.68      |

- **Observations:**
  - EOQ dynamically adjusted for upcoming months.
  - Helps in maintaining optimal inventory levels while reducing holding costs.

### 3️⃣ **Defect Detection Using CNN (Planned Implementation)**

- **Purpose:** Detect defective parts using image classification.
- **Method:**
  - Use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify defects from image data.
  - Integrate predictions with inventory management to exclude defective parts.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Prepare and preprocess image datasets.
  - Train and evaluate CNN model.
  - Integrate defect detection results with the inventory system.
